					In this project we devise a predictive model to generate parameters for autonomous motion of a snake-like robot. The robot uses serpentine motion to move across an obstacle field. It is equiped with several sensors that act like the sensitive body of a snake. The predctive model relies on this sensor data obtained from the snake and the data from previous motion. We postulate that this data can be used to train a predictive model to generate the control parameters required for the motion of the snake-like robot.

					<!-- Start edit here  -->
					A snake-like robot, due to its redundantly many degrees of freedom, has great mobility and flexibility allowing it to navigate though dense obstacle maps where conventional robots cannot traverse. A further, previously unused advantage is the fact that its oscillatory movement allows the bot to use sensors to map a wide portion of its environment. These features make it an invaluable tool in several applications. Thus we try to focus on using simple but elegant techniques to design an autonmous snake-robot.

						<!-- Start edit here  -->
						The snake has several types of moving techniques including side-winding, serpentine and  rectilinear motion. We focus our work on serpentine motion as it can use obstacles as suppport to move along. The serpentine motion is goverened by a controller that takes in several parameters as input. Given these parameters one can generate a variety of motion from the snake. But these parameters have to be manually tuned for a certain type of motion. Taking inspiration from a real snake, we try to move the snake through an obstacle filled map. This will require the snake to change it's motion depending upon the sensor data from the environment. We proppose that this sensor data along with the knowledge of the previous move can be used to predict the upcoming moves for the robot. 					
						However, simply mapping its environment won't suffice for any practical purposes. The sensor data collected from the proximity sensors will be quite unintelligible to humans and it is not practical to feed this data directly to a serpenoid gait controller for autonomous navigation. We need to add an intermediate functional black-box that would implement digital signal processing techniques to predict the subsequent heading directions of the robot.

This paper describes the use of a CNN based technique to learn obstacle aoidance for a simple 2-wheeled robot. It compares several methods used for autnomous navigation. It also reviews the use of CNN's and auto-encoders to solve the problem of obstacle avoidance.

This paper presents a reinforcement learning approach to learn the motion patterns of the snake. It focuses on using the screw and joint angles as control parameters for locomotion. It does not use the pre-defined serpentine control system as the main controller.

This paper is an extension of the original work done by S. Hirose on deriving a mathematical model for serpentine motion of a snake. It describes some modifications on the existing controller in order to make it easier to adapt on real robots. It has been used as the basis for our simulated snake-robot model.

					<div class="heading">3.1 Dataset Description</div>
					<div class="text">

						<!-- Start edit here  -->
						As we are approaching the snake-locomotion problem from a very different angel, we did not have any available dataset. Thus, we designed a simulated snake robot on Vrep (simulation software) to create our own data. We used the modified serpentine controller to control the motion of the robot by manualy tuning the paramters. The set has following division of data - <br>
						<br>
						1 head mounted sensor
						<br>
						16 side mounted sensors. 8 on the left and 8 on the right.
						<br>
						Heading direction value for current motion (c-value)
						<br>
						<br>
						We had 59435 samples for each of the above feature. This data was generated using 45 real-time simulations performed in the snake-robot simulator.

						The dataset was then divided inot training and testing set (70:30). We have used a scaled version of the entire dataset to prevent errors during training and to ease evaluation. The scaling was done as follows -<br>
						Sensor values (0,10) --> (0,1)
						Heading direction (c-value) (-5,5) --> (-1,1)
						<br>
						We have used a single-cell LSTM model to train our data. The training results are -<br>

						Trainig Loss: 0.0019
						Testing Loss: 0.0025
						<br>
						<br>
						The results suggest that the model has behaved pretty well for this problem.

						<!-- Start edit here  -->
						In this work we presented a data-driven approach towards solving a navigation problem for a redundant system. We have successfully shown that it is possible to learn a control strategy by using the surrounding environment as an input. The LSTM based model is able to learn a navigation strategy and use it as control parameter of the serpentine controller.

						<!-- Start edit here  -->
						We have observed that even though the model has shown greart predtion accuracy on the test data, it is not able to provide a proper navigation strategy for the simulated snake-robot. Thus. we aim to work further on this problem to correct the robot behaviour and incorporate goal-directed locomotion into the snake-robot.
